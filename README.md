# Logistic-Regression
This is a programming assignment done for the CSCI 567 - Machine Learning class.

The code above implements the logistic and perceptron algorithms. It also demonstrates the implementation of Stochastic gradient descent and gradient descent for multiclass classification.

classification.py and bm_classify.py implements the algorithm for Logistic Regression. This is a complete implementation that is also provided with a test dataset on mnist.

To run the above code: $ ./multiclass.sh & ./binary.sh
